Is it an App? iPhone Client Edition

A small app developed for the purpose of testing out and becoming familiar with the iTunes App Store submission/review process. Yes, I am fully aware of the fact the application is worthless.

Oh, also it got a glowing review over on Krapps: http://krapps.com/2009/06/24/is-it-an-app-iphone-app/

Sweet.
